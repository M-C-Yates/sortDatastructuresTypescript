Bubble sort

it's basically a double nested for loop that iterates through the entire collection 
several times for every iteration of the main loop

at every pair of elements bubblesort checks to see if the first element is larger than
the second and swaps them if this is true

at the end of the first loop the last element is guarenteed to be the greatest
so the last element can be ignored for every subsequent loop the process then repeats
